## testing in backend

- keep practicing, this skill is very important
- javascript has alot of work arounds, keep each piece of code
- intergration testing and unit testing
- identify what should never fail, test that


## TDD theory
TDD cycle:
- test fails => test passes => refactor

Write tests first (test driven design)

speed up server with supertest (can work with or without jest)

test 3 things:
--check end point return the correct http status code
--endpoint returns the right data format (json)
--end point returns the right data based on input in the body
